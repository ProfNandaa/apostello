Welcome to apostello's documentation!
=====================================

*free SMS communication software for your church*

Introduction
============

apostello is a web app designed to enable a church to communicate with its
congregation via SMS.
Messages can be sent, received and automatically replied to.

apostello was written for use at St Columba's Free Church as we couldn't find
a cheap SMS solution that fit all our needs and has been running in production
since early 2015.

Pull requests are encouraged. Please open an issue before working on anything other than minor bug fixes.
